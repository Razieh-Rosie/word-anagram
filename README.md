# word-anagram

Finding anagrams of English words that have same length.

This is my practice on a Linkedin course called "Python: Data Analysis" by "Michele Vallisneri".
In Chapter 3, there is a challenge on finding anagrams. I will put my version and Vallisneri's version of the solution to this challenge.

In this paragraph, I will go through: what we have, what we need to do, and what the results should be.
First, what we have:
      we have a txt file that contains English words from the nineteen thirty four Webster Dictionary.
second, we need to: 
      clean the dictionary
      find anagram of the words 
      find anagrams that have same length
finally, the result should be word length versus number of anagrams with that length. 

both versions of the solution gives same interpretation, which is that anagrams with the length of 6 character has the most number of words in English dictionary. However, the final numbers does not match, I get 6246 words and Vallisneri get 5153 words.

Any comment is appreciated.

notes: "two words are anagrams of each other when their letters can be rearranged to turn one word into the other. For instance, Elvis and lives are anagrams of each other". (Reference: Michele Vallisneri)
